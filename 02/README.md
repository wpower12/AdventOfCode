# Wrapping Elves

lolol #seewhatididthere.  So fun fact, atom adds a linebreak to the end of
text files by default!  Made for some interesting debugging when I assumed
things about characters being where I wanted them.  Turn it off in the
settings for the whitespace package. 

Onto the elves.  Straightforward?  Seems like there might be some code-golfy
ways to minimize the size, but I like being able to read/understand my stuff
in a somewhat reasonable time frame.
