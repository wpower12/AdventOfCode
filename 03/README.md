# Santa and ROBO SANTA???

Tried in C.  Pretty verbose.  But fun.  The robo-santa one was a lot of
lazy copy and paste, but it works.

Basically read the file to size a grid, then read it again to fill in when
gifts were dropped off.  This is fun, because I also get stuff like what
house gets the most presents for free from the array implementation.
